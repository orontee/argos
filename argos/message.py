    It is expected to be applied to class methods.

    Once the decorator is applied, a message consumer can be
    identified among all class methods of a given class by inspecting
    the presence of the ``consume_message`` attribute. This attribute
    value is the list of message type handled by the consumer.

    consumers with message of type they expect.

    ``Application._identify_message_consumers_from_controllers()``,
    this decorator must be the last operator applied to a class method
    for the consumer identifier to successfully identify a decorated
    class method as being a consumer.
