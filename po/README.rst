============
Translations
============

Contributions welcome!

Howto
=====

People interested in contributing to translations should use the
corresponding `Weblate project
<https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/argos/argos/>`_.

Translations will be pushed by Weblate bot to Github source code
repository, on the ``translations`` branch.

This branch is manually merged in ``main`` branch periodically.

Technical considerations
========================

Translations are stored in `PO files </po>`_ which are textual,
editable files.

To update translation files to match current source code, one must
run::

  $ rm -rf builddir
  $ meson setup builddir .
  $ meson compile -C builddir io.github.orontee.Argos-update-po

üí° A oneliner is available::

  poetry run ./scripts/update-translations
